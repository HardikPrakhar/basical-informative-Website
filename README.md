# Basical Informative Website
Basical informative website made for my parents after a weekly course that I did in 4th year of
high school (2015/2016). This is my first experience in coding.

There are many "Lorem Ipsum" text examples because I've censored informations about people,
their work and contacts.

There are not complicated features, it is just an information website

This project was made by a basical downloaded website template.
